"Blockchain Applications
Blockchain is the new big data. Everyone is talking about it, and no one seems to really know what it is.

Let’s start there. Blockchain is just a way of recording and sharing data in such a way that the same data is visible to everyone. Further, blockchain ensures that the data cannot be changed without everyone knowing exactly who did what.

Blockchain technology fosters trust between two parties, even if those people are anonymous. To say it more technically, blockchain is a shared, programmable, decentralized, cryptographically secure ledger for storing digital objects and transactions. No single user or institution controls blockchain applications. Anyone can scrutinize them.

For example, Bitcoin is an example of a blockchain application. Bitcoin is a digital currency, with a public ledger for all transactions. In addition to digital currency, blockchain technology can handle any transaction that is expressible as computer code. Possible scenarios include:

Insurance claims
Votes
Real estate titles
Driver’s licenses
Someday, voting and national identities can perhaps be supported through blockchain technologies. Blockchain can possibly even be used to trace where your products came from and that they are not fakes. Blockchain is so revolutionary, people are discovering new applications for it every day.
